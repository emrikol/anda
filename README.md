Add New Default Avatar [Emrikol's Fork] plugin for WordPress

This is a very old (5 years) plugin that I created when I first started working with WordPress.  I'm bring it into GitHub, and then doing some minimal updates to it for security and code standards sake, and then I'm going to mostly abandon it.

All of the known security issues in the plugin should be fixed, so it should be safe to use now.
